__Cats vs. Cats__
This is a PvP game in which the user plays as a cat knight against the evil cat king (AI cat boss).
The player uses the A and D keys to move back and forth, as well as the W key to dodge. There are three
different attacks the player can use that each have different levels of damage and health. The attacks
the AI uses are determined by the Minimax Algorithm and a heuristic function that prioritizes the life
of the boss by giving hp values in the low range a grater weight and from there the minimax algorithm
can be used to recursively determine the best score (which correlates to a best attack).
